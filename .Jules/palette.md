**Learning:** Custom file upload drop zones that hide the native file input are inaccessible to keyboard users by default. They require manual `tabindex="0"`, `role="button"`, and a JS `keydown` handler for Enter/Space to trigger the hidden input.
**Action:** When creating or maintaining custom file inputs, always verify keyboard navigation. Ensure the interactive container is focusable and responds to standard activation keys.
